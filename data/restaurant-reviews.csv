All I can say is they have very good ice cream I would for sure recommend their cookies and creme ice cream it is very good
Nice little local place for ice cream.My favorite is their pumpkin shake ( Fall season special).( My Sweetness tolerance is low) Their LARGE SIZE ice cream usually seems too sweet after having ice cream for a while. But love their pina colada. So refreshing. Their Banana Split is good too.
A delicious treat on a hot day! Staff was very friendly and helpful-- gave us a sample and let us order a little earlier than open.
"This was great service and a fun crew! I got the banana cream pie with chocolate ice cream. I loved the flavor of this. It had freshly cut bananas, graham crackers and chocolate ice cream. YUM!! The only thing that I noticed is that it melted pretty fast and it's a bit icy. I like creamier ice cream (so it had a bit more overrun that I prefer), but overall, was delicious!"
"This is one of my favorite places to get ice cream in the CU area. It's a bit of drive, but it is worth it. It's about 10 minutes from the far side of Urbana. Getting there is really easy. The atmosphere of the Dairy Barn is very kid friendly. There are many tables set up so that you can sit and enjoy the ice cream. When my friends and I went, the line was about a 20 minute wait, but it didn't seem like any time at all. An older gentlemen, I presume the manager or owner, was giving out samples to the entire line. You could tell that he took pride in the product he made and was excited to share it with everyone. The special that night was cappuccino ice cream. I added in cookie dough to make a ""tornado"" which is a blizzard like ice cream treat. It was so quite refreshing and was a nice treat on a humid night. The Dairy barn is a must go!"
"I've been coming to this ice cream stand since I was a little girl back in the 1970's. (Yes, it's been here for that long! Just not under the same ownership.) But not much has changed in those years in regards to their basic ice cream. It is a great family place! They are always accommodating when we want to tweak the menu item a bit :-) I love the rotating, special flavor of the week! Keep an eye on the Facebook page for that. It's always a joy to see the near constant long line. Shows how successful a small town business can be. If you are truly passionate about supporting small business, stay away from those franchises that make their ice cream at some corporate factory and come get some made fresh soft serve from your truly local business!!"
"The soft-serve is way too sweet and has a strange Splenda-like aftertaste. The flavors tasted very artificial, and I ended up with a stomach ache when I got home... I really don't recommend this place, your simple Baskin Robbins is much better."
My husband and I stopped here on the way back to Monticello from Westville (Go Sages!). He had a chocolate shake and I had a cookie dough tornado. Both were very tasty and refreshing. What a cute place filled with character. The service was very friendly and efficient. I love small town gems like this!
"Little piece of heaven, the best ice cream shop near Champaign Urbana. Decent prices, superb taste; What else do you need on a hot summer day! This place is cash only, and sometimes you can smell cow dung. Other than that, this place serves far better ice cream than neighboring ice cream parlors (like Jarlings) of Champaign-Urbana."
"Went here for the 1st time tonight. I ordered a turtle tornado. It was excellent. TONS of pecans and lots of flavor. I guess I could be picky and say that it melted incredibly fast. Too bad my wife and son didn't have the same experience. My son ordered a plain chocolate cone. My wife ordered a vanilla cone w/ a chocolate dip. I tasted both, after they said theirs didn't taste very good. I totally agreed. Both were very watery in flavor. My sons had a bit of an icy consistency. Instead of ice cream or custard - they resembled ice milk. Not going back. Jarling's Custard Cup is way, way better."
"Our bike club comes here often year round for evening ice cream cycling excursions from Champaign-Urbana. The staff is always VERY friendly and accommodating. The ice cream is tasty, although I do prefer the fattier taste of custard. All in all, a wonderful place to visit."
Best ice cream in the area! I love their featured flavor of the week! The staff is always very friendly and the service is generally pretty fast!
Delicious ice cream. Best soft serve I've ever had in my entire life. Staff is wonderful and friendly and even though they only have a few flavors it will leave you in a wonderful happy place and life will be good.
"Local Dairy Barn that served your typical traditional American dairy products. The ice cream was itself was so rich that I could taste the milk. If you just simply want an ice cream or something simple, this is definitely a good place to go. But personally I see nothing too special about the place. There's ample amount of parking in their private lot, but expect there to always be full of locals populating the area. When in doubt, just make your own parking spot. I know I did"
The best soft serve hands down...no further explanation needed!! Every flavor...those that are constant or those that change weekly...LOVE. THE. BEST.
Best home made style ice cream. I stop by any time I am near Sidney and make special trips from my home 13 miles away from time to time.
"Definitely have to check out their facebook for the flavor of the week! We were there for coffee flavored and it was delicious. I have to go back to check out the lemon, as I have heard wonderful things about it. Definitely worth the drive if you're looking for something different than custard"
"Much better than Champaign's Jarlings. Better service, better ice cream, and the lines usually significantly shorter. Worth the drive!!"
Basically the best thing since sliced bread. Definitely worth the trip outside of Champaign!!
"I LOVE the Dairy Barn. 20 minutes east of CU, this is the picture perfect small town ice cream place. Outdoor, order at the window and sit on the picnic tables under the festive outdoor lighting to enjoy your soft serve treats. Chocolate and vanilla always available, with a rotating special third flavor (I love mint week!). There are always special tornadoes (think blizzard) to match the flavor of the week. I also recommend the raspberry truffle tornado; raspberry flavored ice cream with magic shell-like dipping chocolate mixed in. If you want a short journey and some awesome ice cream, go to Sidney Dairy Barn! Update: I love Dairy Barn. It should have 5 stars. What's my problem?"
"This is still the best soft serve I know, in the world. My favorite flavors are mint and cherry. Their flavors are subtle, mild, and the cream is not overly sweet. Lately, the ice cream I've had at other ice cream establishments has been so sweet that it's actually inspired this positive review. I once finished a quart of Sidney Dairy Barn ice cream, in an afternoon, by myself. At other places I'll only have a small cup and I'll feel sick and renounce ice cream for a month -- how depressing. I don't know what else they do differently, but the milk is fresh and the flavors are right. It's basically a stand in the middle of corn fields - at last that's how I remember it - and they're only open during the summer. I always go out of my way to come to Sidney Dairy Barn and it's always a trip worth taking. P.S. CASH or CHECK only."
"This place is the bomb, and absolutely the kind of place that makes it worth searching around for the best local joints on a road trip. We spotted it on a hiking trip and made a stop on our way out, and it was flat-out amazing, as you could probably guess based on the long lines stretching out at dusk. The service was incredibly efficient for such a tiny joint, and they had a good selection of flavors; but the food was the real attraction, amazing ice cream desserts made from that fresh country cream that you can taste the minute it hits your tongue. It's also got 1970s prices, which makes the massive sugar rush all the more worthwhile."
"Ice cream is good but the service could be improved. I rarely get what I actually order. A peanut butter cup tornado with chocolate ice cream isn't that hard to understand or make. They just lack attention to detail. First they made me a m&m tornado with chocolate ice cream and when I told them it was supposed to be peanut butter cup, I got a peanut butter cup with vanilla ice cream. This didn't happen just once either. My order is wrong more times than it is right! I'll just start telling them to surprise me since I always am when I go here."
"GREAT ice cream! It's a frequent trip for us from St. Joe. Don't be surprised by long lines, but they have a good routine and send the orders out very timely. You can't compare it to Jarlings, as that is frozen custard, but it's still very tasty. I like that the Facebook page posts their flavor of the week. Hope they stay around a long time!"
Great little ice cream stand in Sidney. Delicious and inexpensive and excellent service from friendly staff! I highly recommend a stop and you too will be hooked!
"A local favorite! Very worth the drive, they are more than happy to make you whatever you can dream up! Like most soft-serve/custard places, they serve their regular flavors and a flavor of the week. Creme de mint is so tasty! But so are the fruity flavors. You can also catch the Moo-mobile at the Urbana Farmer's Market and other local events. I like their ice cream sandwiches but when I visit the Sidney location, only a chocolate dipped cone will do!"
"Pro-tip: Definitely give the rotating ice cream flavors a try - they offer samples! The double scoop is worth the money if you're sharing with someone. Highlights: The female workers the night we went were super nice and so honest with their opinions about the ice cream flavors. They let us sample a few of them and then gave us the biggest double scoop! For sure worth $6. The ice cream itself was insanely good, very creamy, rich, and actually better than a ton of ice cream shops in the area. Lowlights: Some of the ice cream flavors on the menu weren't actually available which was a little disappointing."
"After seeing some positive reviews about Rewind, I wanted to stop by and check it out for myself. A store that sells boba and ice cream at the same time? Say less and hook me up because I'm coming over at the speed of light. Now onto the review: Dessert/Drink (3/5): For the drink, I got a Blueberry Matcha Latte and I got the Matcha Madness (in a cone) for dessert. Let's start with the drink. As someone who absolutely loves matcha, I knew I had to order this. It is different from most matcha drinks I typically see in which this one comes with blueberry puree. The drink was a good size for what the price was; however, the drink isn't that spectacular. The matcha flavor was nice but the blueberry didn't really add any wow factor to the drink. If anything, I felt as if I couldn't ever taste the blueberry so that was rather disappointing. The Matcha Madness ice cream included the following toppings: two pocky sticks and chocolate shavings. I find that the ice cream itself was pretty smooth and had a really good matcha flavor to it. Only downside was that it was really melty within a minute and the ice cream wasn't as pretty/have a nice swirling effect. Atmosphere (5/5): The establishment was really pretty and I absolutely love the vibe. Decor was pretty minimal but any place that has a neon sign and a grass wall is amazing in my eyes haha. The store was also very clean and neat. Seating was pretty limited as there was only 4 - 5 tables. Service (4/5): Service was alright. I didn't find it to special or felt that workers went out of their way. Did notice that a worker was talking to their buddies when people were waiting to order. Overall, just lack of attention to customers; however, the drink and ice cream came out at a good pace. Overall, Rewind offers customers a good mixture of drinks and ice cream selection to satisfy any sweet cravings. The attention to customer could be improved but timing between order and handout was good. Would I come back? If I was in the area then maybe, but I certainly wouldn't go out of my way to go. Might only get ice cream if I go though as the drink was average."
I got the special! Orange creamsicle flavored soft serve. Comes topped w orange gummy bears. It tasted like orange sherbet that was shaped like soft serve. Defo not like an orange creamsicle. For $8.5 i feel like there should have been more richness or icecream-likeness. If I wanted orange sherbet I would go to walmart. I'll be trying one of their original blends next time.
This was the longest wait I've had for an ice cream cone. Also the most I've paid for one. Almost 10$ for an ice cream cone. Nothing to write home about. This was a miss for me
"I used to looove this place (hence my previous 5 star review), but the last few times it's been so beyond lacking in service. I don't know if it's what I've been ordering or what, but it takes forever! And I don't think a shake at an ice cream place is crazy. People will get served way before and I've had to ask if my stuff is going to come out. When you ask it's like a lightbulb comes on and they realize they forgot your items. I asked for two scoops of ice cream the first time and that took 25 minutes to get (after asking about it). This most recent time was a mint chocolate chip ""bowl"" (which came out timely but melted all over my jeans and car by the end of it because they couldn't give me a lid) and a strawberry shortcake shake (which took crazy long to produce). I love this place, but I have no idea what is happening."
"Great spot to drop by after a long day of volleyball and a good dinner. Convenient that they have boba drinks, ice cream, shakes, etc - something to please everybody! The girls opted for a Taro Milk Tea and the Butterfly Strawberry Lemonade - both with boba. I chose the Chocolate Crumble Ice Cream cone. Everybody was happy with their choices & enjoyed the late night refreshment. If you haven't tried it out & your in the Tempe area, give it a shot & see what you think!"
Nicely decorated spot for sweets and drinks! Good place to catch up with people or a quick stop to treat yourself. Got Vietnamese Coffee and Tiramisu ice cream and we LOVE the Vietnamese coffee! So good and strong with coffee flavor. Matcha Immuni-Tea: matcha was light but good if you like green tea. Butterfly Rose Lemonade: pretty and a refreshing drink. Would recommend!
The rose milk tea latte is my wife's favorite in AZ. I enjoy their immunity-teas. Haven't had an item I didn't like yet. Plenty of parking and seating at this location. The ice cream looks great too but I don't have much of a sweet tooth to try. Looks like you can get it mixed with your favorite cereal.
"Rewind has a trendy look, but the beauty isn't just skin deep. This is my go to boba place when I'm in Chandler. Layered drinks like the rose milk latte aren't just eye-catching on Instagram-- they're also delicious! I've tried their milk tea and their fruity tea, and they do both well. I would definitely bring anyone here, because they serve things like ice cream and can please people who don't like/aren't willing to try boba. It's also a little cheaper than some other boba places around here. Every time I've been here, the staff have been exceptionally nice. That, coupled with how quickly they make drinks, is what really makes them a five star establishment in my eyes. They also have a good variety of flavors, including non dairy and caffeine free choices, and the ability to customize sugar levels. Someday I'll get ice cream here, but their tea is so good that I haven't been able to not order it!"
"Came here for boba and hmm... their drinks look so cute and all that, but I had thai milk tea with boba and the tea was ok but the boba was undercooked. I feel like even when the tea taste good, if boba is hard and undercooked, I tend to feel that drink isn't good, and I guess that was the case. Although, I came here for ice cream one time, and their ice cream was pretty flavorful, they have some of the very unique flavors, I think I had Vietnamese coffee flavored ice cream and it was pretty good! Probably I'll come back here for the ice cream but not for boba!"
"I scrolled through Google to find the closest Boba place and found Rewind. It was so worth the 15 minutes! I LOVED EVERYTHING I ORDERED. The staff was so kind and friendly, the atmosphere was so calming. A good place to sit down and enjoy your boba. The decor is so aesthetically pleasing. It was so delicious, I almost cried it was gone. The rose milk latte was so fresh and sweet which is how I love my boba. I also tried the house coffee with rose cream (not pictured) was so good and refreshing. It was Literal perfection! I cannot wait to come back!"
This ice cream was exceptionally good. I would so come back here next time I'm in PHX. Think of getting soft serve ice cream mixed in with you favorite cereal... this is the place to go!
"I love coming here. It's the first boba place I went to after moving to the valley. Their customer service is amazing, everyone is super kind every time. They have so many options. Delicious locally made ice cream with vegan options! The establishment is always clean and picture ready. There's not enough nice things to be said about Rewind."
This place was delicious! They had lots of vegan options. I didn't know vegan ice cream could taste like the real deal. They also had lots of options of non vegan ice cream as well. You can taste test them if you'd like. It's a little pricier but worth it!
Great service! Not your average ice cream stop but work a stop to try something different. Fun choices for kids and adults
"Craving some bubble tea? Be kind, visit Rewind! This shop is in the same plaza as Pokitrition, Culver's and Firehouse Subs so you can can get some food in addition to drinks and dessert if you so desire. The menu has a plethora of ice cream and bubble tea options. I opted for the brown sugar milk tea, mountain green immuni-T and a lychee peach green tea. I enjoyed every drink! The brown sugar milk tea had a good balance of sweetness + creaminess and had a hint of caramel undertone in it. I wanted it with boba but unfortunately it would have taken 30 minutes for them to make it. I personally think if you're a bubble tea shop you should always have boba ready and waiting for the customer during business hours, especially if the only mix in options for your drinks are boba or crystal boba. The immuni-T was filled with fresh ginger, lemon and honey. It was cool and refreshing with a bit of a kick to it from the ginger. I also enjoyed the lychee peach green tea, a delicate tasting and lightly sweetened drink. Service was good and I was happy with the sweetness amounts the bobarista recommended for each drink. I'll be back to try more if I'm in the area."
"There is a lot of variety at Rewind, from soft serve with mix-ins, various sweet tea concoctions, and scoop ice cream. I tried a vanilla swirl with Reese's peanut butter cups mixed in - kind of like a Blizzard at DQ, with banana slices on top. The ice cream was quite sweet. The presentation was nice with bananas strategically placed. It was very soft and started melting over my cup almost immediately even though it was a cold day so prepare to start eating right away."
"GREAT LOOKING ICE CREAM Went right up to the counter to order. There are many yummy sounding ice cream combinations but I got the Minion's Treat. I also decided to get the Thai Tea Crush. There were a lot of people that ordered before me but everyone's ice cream came out in a timely manner. The ice cream gets blended with your choice of mix-ins. Personally I thought there was not enough mixed in as not every bite was flavorful. Even though every bite was not packed with bananas and Frosted Flakes, it was still good. The Thai Tea Crush was good but a bit watery for me. Overall, try it out if you want a cold instagramable looking treat."
This spot is definitely in my top 5 for Thai tea. I ordered my Thai tea at 50% sweetness and I'm happy I did because their boba was surprisingly pretty sweet which was a great surprise. Probably some of the best boba I've had. Thai tea had great flavor. My only complaint was the cashier taking the order. When we were ready to order he just looked at us and didn't say a word. Not sure what his deal was but he needs some more training on customer service. Gotta stop by here if you like Thai tea though.
"Dropped by Rewind on a weekday and was not disappointed in the least! I love strawberry matcha drinks and was so used to being able to find them all over the Bay. However, I hadn't really found a good place to grab one in AZ. I ordered the strawberry matcha with boba at 75% sweetness. First off, the boba was great! It had the perfect chewiness and was sweet without being overly sugary. Definitely a plus point here. The drink itself was good though the strawberry was a bit more artificial than I liked. It also was not as rich as I am used to so that was the only tiny critique I had. Overall, this place is cute and the drinks are delicious. Service is friendly as well. I will definitely be back to try other menu items including the ice cream which looked scrumptious! In regards to Covid, it was great to see everyone wearing masks. There is seating outside with spaced tables if you would like to brave the heat and sip your drinks before heading home. Parking is quite easy within the complex so you can attempt to drink your tea in the car instead of melting as well."
This is a very popular place. There was a lot of foot traffic in and out which was a good sign. They have a simple menu and easy to understand. Ambiance inside was nice and bright. Seating is limited. There is outdoor seating but very limited as well. The staff were great. They explained the menu what the new flavors were and the wait time for everything. They provide samples if needed and the amount of ice cream is a good amount. The shakes are great even the coconut I was great in place of vanilla. It would be good to have more flavors available for the shakes. There are a good amount of choices for the boba. Looking forward to coming
Absolutely awful experience!! It was hair in my ice cream and the manager was super rude about it and said they don't give refunds!
"Rewind is a matcha specialty cafe which I was really excited to try. I have been here for both ice cream and boba drinks. They have both soft serve and hard scoop artisanal varieties. I ordered the Matcha Madness soft serve which came with chocolate shavings and picky sticks. I found the matcha flavor to be bland unfortunately. The hard scoop ice creams are not available in matcha flavor. On to the drinks, I ordered the strawberry matcha latte at the recommended 75% sweetness. The matcha flavoring was quite prominent, I was very happy with my choice. I would like to try the Matcha Americano next. I also had the Butterfly Strawberry Lemonade. Its colors were so beautiful I hesitated to mix it up but alas, must move forward. This drink is pretty unique in that none of the flavors are distinctive. If someone handed me the drink I would not have guessed it contained strawberries or lemons. It was a little too sweet for me at 75%, I would order 50% next time."
"The bobas were chewy and hard. They could keep the kitchen area cleaner and better stocked. One of the staff members was polite and another was expressive in a not-polite way. I asked if they sold like tubs of ice creams with toppings (If they did I wanted to take four multiple folks). In my mind, they could say no which the polite one said. But the other one looked annoyed. Use questions as a way to enhance customer experience. They have a lot of room to improve."
"So happy my brother and sister-in-law sent over a little surprise from Rewind. Now I have this place on my list. Drinks were super yummy. The Thai tea was delicious and is always a good drink to default on when you're having a hard time choosing from all the other milk teas. I'll have to stop in to see the rest of the menu but I'm confident that they'll be just as good as the three that were delivered. Also, their quality does not lack as you can see from the photos. The drinks traveled well."
"One of my favorite local ice cream spot! They always shave delicious drinks, boba and coffee. My personal favorite order is the: vanilla ice cream infused with fruity pebbles and I usually add boba as a topping in a cup. Sometimes they get confused if you ask for boba as a topping, but ask for it in a cup and it should be ok! The brown sugar milk tea and rose milk tea latte are my go to drinks. Their butterfly rose lemonade is pretty good too! Very refreshing and perfect for Instagram pictures. They also have so many different matcha drinks!"
"Been in AZ for 3 weeks now and have been impressed by all the tea shops around! From Rewind I went bold and got the matcha coffee, which I usually don't get when I go to tea shops that have them! Also went with a safe jasmine milk tea. The Jasmine milk tea at 50% sugar was perfect for my husband and I, whereas the matcha coffee at 50% sugar was too sweet. Will probably get 25% sweetness for that one next time but overall this place was really good!"
"Came here a few days ago with my s/o after ordering a brown sugar milk tea (50% sweet) with boba and a coffee crush online. Unfortunately, they were out of regular boba by the time we arrived, so I ended up with aloe vera. The tea itself was great and aromatic, but the aloe vera didn't pair well (not Rewind's fault, just a bad choice that I made!) I found the coffee crush altogether too sweet, but my s/o liked it fine. One thing to note is that the online ordering is a little buggy--I had originally wanted to order a Thai Tea w/ boba, but the online ordering didn't give me the option of adding boba to the thai tea. Would recommend ordering at the store instead of online, which also would prevent you from ordering something that isn't available. (If I had known they were out of black boba, we would have gone elsewhere) Overall, service was a little slow, but otherwise a cute store with friendly staff and tasty drinks."
"Let me say, I usually love this place. My negative review is that I've driven to their location and ordered through app and my favorite item is on the website and online order form and it's not something they claim to carry except seasonally. If you don't want to carry Pineapple Express year round, please remove it from your Chandler location menu."
"My husband and I were on our way home from grocery pickup and decided to get a quick treat from Rewind. After much deliberation, I decided on the Rose Milk Latte and my husband ordered the Hojicha Latte. The employees were friendly and speedy in getting our drinks made and out to us, especially appreciated during these times! My Rose Milk Latte was as expected; definitely had a subtle Rose flavor and at 75% sweet, was a good amount of sweetness ... I only ordered the smaller size last time, but would probably get the large next time. I had gotten my drink with the crystal boba which was pretty difficult to find. Not sure what the normal amount is but the quantity I received left me wishing there was more. The Hojicha Latte had a very distinct flavor, almost earthy. Probably would not get this one again but this drink had much more boba than mine. Overall, a cute litte spot. They have a variety of tea drinks, ice creams, shakes, and so on. More like a 3.50 star review for this experience but rounding up to 4."
"This place is so good! I love an ice cream place where you can customize your flavor and Dripps does that to perfection! The best part of it is they use cereal flavors blended into the ice cream and then you can add toppings to add to the delicious ice cream you created. I got the Captain Crunch Berries ice cream blend with gummy bears. Perfectly creamy ice cream that tastes freshly made with just the right amount of cereal flavors throughout the ice cream. The best part is they have a wide choices of cereals from frosted flakes to Apple Jack's to name a few. We also tried out a few of teas like the Matcha and the Rose tea. Both are delicious, not too sweet and very Instagramable looking! It's a must to add boba to the drink. Good here to get your treats on cause this place is one of the best in Arizona!"
"If you are a fan of watching Saturday morning cartoons and eating a big bowl of cereal, this place is for you! The menu is full of many fun options with their ice cream-cereal concoctions. Unfortunately, this place just wasn't for me. The combination of ice cream and cereal was fun but overall nothing special. I would probably return to try again to see if I can find something more to my liking. The place is very Instagramable tho! Note: I have only tried the ice cream, cannot speak to any other menu items."
"YES YES YES! This place was so good. I had heard about it from a news article because of they way the ""drill"" the ice cream to mix and serve it. We went and I got an ice cream with cinnamon toast mixed in and brownie bites on top. My friends got milkshakes. It was all super tasty and delicious. I felt the portion size to price was affordable for the milkshake but I felt the price was a bit high for the amount of ice cream you got; although it was really tasty. My only complaint about this place, although it would only stop me if there were really long lines, was that the service was kind of slow. After ordering it took about 10 to 15 minutes to get our ice cream and two shakes. There was only one person before us that came in. The people who came in after us had to wait a few minutes before their order was taken. Again, it would not stop me from coming back and the flavor was really good but the wait time, I felt, is an area for improvement and maybe would push me away if there were long lines."
I was really impressed with my whole experience at Rewind! The employees greeted me with kindness and did a fantastic job in explaining the items on their menu. I ordered the matcha ice cream and it turned out to be very delicious. I also love the setting inside where you can get some pretty cool pictures. I wish more ice cream spots shared the same energy as the folks from Rewind do. I'll be coming back for more!
I'm impressed! Only had their drinks but both times it was very delicious. Had the matcha strawberry and pink crush. Decent prices and quality drinks!
i'm a fan! i stopped here for a quick dessert date with a girlfriend of mine and we both got one drink and one ice cream creation each! i decided to create my own using their vanilla base with fruity pebbles mixed in and topped with more fruity pebbles. it was soooo good. it was dense and creamy - loved that the ice cream didn't start to melt right away too. I also tried their Pink Cloud drink and presentation-wise it was 5/5. Unfortunately I didn't try it before my ice cream so I couldn't get the true flavor or taste of the drink. :( that just means i'll need to come back though! Would def recommend if you're in the area.
"both times I've been, their boba is cooking and won't be done for about 30mins. What is the point in offering boba tea when your boba isn't ready ever. Maybe start making the boba before you open? Giving up on this place."
Rewind has super delicious drinks. I tried the sweet matcha with crystal boba (they ran out of black boba sadly) and it tasted just like it's from Japan! Staff was friendly and I can't wait to go back to try more of their yummy creations!
It's Valentines Day and me without a Valentine decided to treat myself with a big ol' ice cream cone. Not something I do often so this is big. I walk in and there's about 4 people waiting (6 ft apart) and the folks behind the counter were hoofing it! Their fabulous creations went quickly by and I give my order after a little wait. Hand made is worth a small wait. I've been here for tea though this time my Minions Favorite ice cream cone blew my socks off. Frosted Flakes in little pieces inside my ice cream groovy! You gotta try this place. I live in the neighborhood and supporting small businesses is a priority for me. I'll keep coming back because they're worth it!
Pretty fast service for this COVID19 situation w limited workers. The employees are super friendly and they have plenty of disinfectants when you walk in. Clean environment and the boba is amazing like always. Any matcha drinks and the brown sugar boba are amazing. I also appreciate the milk substitutes available.
"Weekend of firsts! Happened into this place because we tried the sushi burrito place in the same strip mall. Young lady explained the options so went with Minion's Treat (ice cream, Frosted Flakes, banana)...so good! Frosted Flakes are mixed into the ice cream along with banana. Whole think mixed together and topped with more flakes and few banana slices. Talk about decadent in a cup! Wife had the Thunder Buddies (Reese's Puff, banana mixed in and topped with almond slices, bananas and Teddy Grahams). So yummy and fun concept!"
"I came here for the second time last week for bubble tea. The first time I visited, my brother and I came in to try the cereal-infused ice cream I had read about. I had ordered the Thunder Buddies and he ordered a Cookies and Cream shake. I'm not going to lie, I wanted to steal his milkshake after trying it!! Both visits, the staff was very quick to greet me and will offer to explain the menu if you haven't been there before. This time there was a girl working behind the counter and I asked her about the Brown Sugar Milk Tea sweetness. She had a sample that she was able to offer me and indicated that she could make it more or less sweet. The sample was the perfect amount of sweet! I went ahead and order that with boba added. I'm definitely a fan and would come back and try it again!"
This place has great boba tea however they are always out of boba. I have gone many times all the way down to chandler to only find out they have no more :/. Still a great place!
"Drinks were quickly made and very tastyy, cured my boba cravings l. The shop was cute inside as well :))"
