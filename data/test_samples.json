    "text": "Craving some bubble tea? Be kind, visit Rewind! This shop is in the same plaza as Pokitrition, Culver's and Firehouse Subs so you can can get some food in addition to drinks and dessert if you so desire. The menu has a plethora of ice cream and bubble tea options. I opted for the brown sugar milk tea, mountain green immuni-T and a lychee peach green tea. I enjoyed every drink! The brown sugar milk tea had a good balance of sweetness + creaminess and had a hint of caramel undertone in it. I wanted it with boba but unfortunately it would have taken 30 minutes for them to make it. I personally think if you're a bubble tea shop you should always have boba ready and waiting for the customer during business hours, especially if the only mix in options for your drinks are boba or crystal boba. The immuni-T was filled with fresh ginger, lemon and honey. It was cool and refreshing with a bit of a kick to it from the ginger. I also enjoyed the lychee peach green tea, a delicate tasting and lightly sweetened drink. Service was good and I was happy with the sweetness amounts the bobarista recommended for each drink. I'll be back to try more if I'm in the area.",
